##Read and clean the data: 

Retaining line, station name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. 

```{r Reading and Cleaning}
options(tibble.print_min = 3)

NYC_transit_data = read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada)
```

Converting the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical variable (the ifelse or recode function may be useful).
